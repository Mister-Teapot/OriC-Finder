Genome size is not very consistent. The max distance that two oriC can be from each other will
be set to 2.0 % of the sequence length of the total genome length rather than a fixed number for all genomes.

INFORMATION
There were 1183 organisms.
	733 times both databases predicted the same amount of oriCs.
	235 times DoriC predicted more oriCs.
	215 times mine predicted more oriCs.

If a DoriC sample had 2 oriC and the predictor predicted 4, we only use the top 2 predicted oriC to create the matches.
The extra oriCs found by my predictor did not lead to any more matches with oriCs from DoriC.
	There were a total of 1484 oriCs predicted by DoriC
	There were a total of 1462 oriCs predicted by my predictor

1209 out of 1484 (81.47 %) DoriC oriCs were found by my predictor with max accepted distance of 2.0 % of the sequence length

2 DoriC oriC were matched to mutliple Z_oriC. (> 0 is not okay)
	This means there are Z_oriC that are closer than 2.0 % of the sequence length to each other.
265 Z_oriC were matched to mutliple DoriC oriC. (> 0 is okay)
	This means there are DoriC oriC that are closer than 2.0 % of the sequence length to each other.

The Z_oriC was off by 101757 bp on average.
