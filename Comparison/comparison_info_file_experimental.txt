INFORMATION
There were 12 organisms.
	7 times both databases predicted the same amount of oriCs.
	2 times DoriC predicted more oriCs.
	3 times mine predicted more oriCs.

If a DoriC sample had 2 oriC and the predictor predicted 4, we only use the top 2 predicted oriC to create the matches.
The extra oriCs found by my predictor did not lead to any more matches with oriCs from DoriC.
	There were a total of 14 oriCs predicted by DoriC
	There were a total of 17 oriCs predicted by my predictor

12 out of 14 (85.71 %) DoriC oriCs were found by my predictor with max accepted distance of 2.0 % of the sequence length

0 DoriC oriC were matched to mutliple Z_oriC. (> 0 is not okay)
2 Z_oriC were matched to mutliple DoriC oriC. (> 0 is okay)
	This means there are DoriC oriC that are closer than 2.0 % of the sequence length to each other.
