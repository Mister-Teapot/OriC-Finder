INFORMATION
There were 1322 organisms.
	597 times both databases predicted the same amount of oriCs.
	183 times DoriC predicted more oriCs.
	542 times mine predicted more oriCs.

If a DoriC sample had 2 oriC and the predictor predicted 4, we only use the top 2 predicted oriC to create the matches.
The extra oriCs found by my predictor did not lead to any more matches with oriCs from DoriC.
	There were a total of 1640 oriCs predicted by DoriC
	There were a total of 1997 oriCs predicted by my predictor

1352 out of 1640 (82.44 %) DoriC oriCs were found by my predictor with max accepted distance of 3.0 % of the sequence length

0 DoriC oriC were matched to mutliple Z_oriC. (> 0 is not okay)
299 Z_oriC were matched to mutliple DoriC oriC. (> 0 is okay)
	This means there are DoriC oriC that are closer than 3.0 % of the sequence length to each other.

The Z_oriC was off by 83122 bp on average.
