INFORMATION
There were 7305 organisms.
	5273 times both databases predicted the same amount of oriCs.
	2032 times DoriC predicted more oriCs.
	0 times mine predicted more oriCs.

There were a total of 9345 oriCs predicted by DoriC
There were a total of 7305 oriCs predicted by my predictor

vvv
8107 out of 9345 (86.75 %) DoriC oriCs were found by my predictor with max accepted distance of 3.0 % of the sequence length
6117 out of 7305 (83.74 %) Z_oriCs found a D_oriC with max accepted distance of 3.0 % of the sequence length

0 DoriC oriC were matched to mutliple Z_oriC. (> 0 is not okay)
1986 Z_oriC were matched to mutliple DoriC oriC. (> 0 is okay)
	This means there are DoriC oriC that are closer than 3.0 % of the sequence length to each other.

The Z_oriC was off by 87265.26 bp on average.
The Z_oriC was off by 2.77 % of the genome on average.
