INFORMATION
There were 7305 organisms.
	5273 times both databases predicted the same amount of oriCs.
	2032 times DoriC predicted more oriCs.
	0 times mine predicted more oriCs.

There were a total of 9345 oriCs predicted by DoriC
There were a total of 5018 oriCs predicted by my predictor

vvv
6547 out of 9345 (70.06 %) DoriC oriCs were found by my predictor with max accepted distance of 3.0 % of the sequence length
4892 out of 5018 (97.49 %) Z_oriCs found a D_oriC with max accepted distance of 3.0 % of the sequence length

0 DoriC oriC were matched to mutliple Z_oriC. (> 0 is not okay)
1651 Z_oriC were matched to mutliple DoriC oriC. (> 0 is okay)
	This means there are DoriC oriC that are closer than 3.0 % of the sequence length to each other.

The Z_oriC was off by 28901.67 bp on average.
The Z_oriC was off by 0.55 % of the genome on average.
